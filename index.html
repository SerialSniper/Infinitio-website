                We are making an ultra realistic pack too!
                Ours, differently from others,<br>
                will be more focused on a brutalist style,
                and it'll contain rougher textures.<br>

            <h1>What makes it different</h1>
            <p>
                What makes our pack different from others is that we'll go for full quality:<br>
                every single texture will be highly worked on and will be optimized for the best experience.<br>
                <br>
                Here are some examples:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Every texture will have a normal and spectral map, as it's the standard for such packs</li>
                    <li>Most of the textures, those that fit well, will have ctm! It indeed will transform into other materials between blocks</li>
                    <li>Every texture will be almost perfectly seamless! This means that you won't have any ugly lines between them</li>
                    <li>Many textures will be wider than 1x1 block: some will take up 4x4 blocks and many will be randomized too, to avoid repetitions</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
